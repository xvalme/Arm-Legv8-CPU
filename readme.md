#ARM LEGv8 in Verilog

Description of a Datapath in verilog, trying to replicate an ARM CPU.
For now, I have only the single cycle version. Still learning the pipelaned one :D.
Used for my learning Quest of HDL :rocket:. Tried to follow best coding practices, while also creating in separate files the testbenches and each module. I hope this is usefull to anyone.
